                <li><a href="">My Hobbies and Interests: back in 2018, when I was in school, I enjoyed coding and creating Android applications in Android Studio. I built websites, did front-end tasks, copied various sites, and then started making my own mods for Minecraft. However, after the quarantine, I lost interest in many things. But soon I became interested in car repairs and construction work. The processes of repair brought me joy and a new passion, so I found another hobby. Now, Iâ€™m studying to become a programmer and also do car repairs in a friend's garage.</a></li>
